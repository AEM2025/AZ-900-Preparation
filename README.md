# AZ-900-Preparation
Resources to be prepared for Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam (AZ-900)


exam includes three knowledge domain areas:

|AZ-900 Domain Area	| Weight |
--------------------------|-------|
|Describe cloud concepts  |	25-30%|
|Describe Azure architecture and services |	35-40%|
|Describe Azure management and governance	|30-35%|

## My Notes:

### 1 - Describe cloud concepts:
<ul>
<li>Cloud models:
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Private cloud: on-premises data center.</li>
    <li>Public cloud: third party cloud provider who manage everything.</li>
    <li>Hybrid cloud: use both public and private.</li>
    <li>Multi-cloud: you're working with many cloud providers.</li>
    <li>Azure Arc: a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment (public, private, hybrid, multi cloud).</li>
    <li>Azure VMware Solution: lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li>Consumption-based model has many benefits:
  <ol type="1">
    <li>No upfront costs.</li>
    <li>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.</li>
    <li>The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.</li>
    <li>The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li> High availability: 
  <ul> 
  <li>SLAs (service-level agreements): uptime guarantees.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Scalability:
  <ul>
    <li>Vertical scaling: add more CPU and memory. Scaling up and scaling down.</li>
    <li>Horizontal scaling: add more vms containers to custmize your solution. Scaling out and scaling in.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Reliability: The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.</li>
<li>Predictability: in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence.</li>
<li>Performance predictability: focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers.</li>
<li>Cost predictability: is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. </li>

<li>Management in the cloud:
<ol type="1">
    <li>Through a web portal.</li>
    <li>Using a command line interface.</li>
    <li>Using APIs.</li>
    <li>Using PowerShell.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): is most suited to a lift and shift migration from an on-premises datacenter to a cloud deployment.</li>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS): Finance and Expense tracking solution typically be in.</li>
</ul>
